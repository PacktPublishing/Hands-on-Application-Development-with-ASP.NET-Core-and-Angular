This is the code repository for [Hands-on Application Development with ASP.NET Core and Angular [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/hands-application-development-aspnet-core-and-angular-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788290449), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Gone are the frameworks with the monolithic approach. Latest frameworks tend to be more modular. ASP.NET Core is a rewrite of ASP.NET and more advanced like Angular. This Video course is a guide for developers who have heard and became curious about the increasing popularity of Angular and ASP.NET Core but do not know how to start.

In this course, we will straight jump into the development of Single Page Application with ASP.NET Core & Angular. Step by step seeing the application being developed will give us the real development flow of single page application. We will cover the important topics of Angular like modules, components, services, and routing. 

On the other hand, learning the use of ASP.NET Core will give us the freedom to be platform independent. It doesn’t matter whether it is Windows, MacOS or Linux, the application will run everywhere. We will create angular services which will help us communicate with the web services in the backend. We will also learn how to use the HTTP Client of Angular. and how we can make different HTTP calls. 


We will use Web API in the backend and Entity Framework Core to generate our database automatically from our code. We will see the use of popular software named “Postman” in this course as well. How to use Angular CLI is also an important topic that will be covered.

At the end of this video course, we will be able to build a complete single page app with two of the most impressive frameworks of this time.
